**Problem Statement:**
Accessing information from databases can be complex, often requiring SQL expertise and causing delays for users who need to retrieve data quickly. This is especially challenging for non-technical users who rely on support from technical teams to extract and view database information, limiting agile, data-driven decision-making.

**Solution:**
Data Navigator, currently a proof of concept, addresses this by allowing users to input natural language queries that an AI component converts into SQL commands. Built with React and Spring Boot, it connects to a single database, executes the generated SQL queries, and displays the resulting data dynamically in a tabular format on the UI. This enables quick, intuitive data access without SQL knowledge, empowering users to retrieve insights independently and efficiently.
